# What it does
We implement a Library Management System (LMS) to simplify and streamline library 
operations. The system will manage book inventory, member registration, loans, and returns while 
offering access to e-books and generating reports. This LMS will improve efficiency, provide a 
better user experience, and meet the growing demand for digital library resources.
